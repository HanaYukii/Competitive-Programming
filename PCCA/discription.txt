Discription:
There are N cities have route between them, the routes are undirected and form a tree(undirected acyclic graph). 
The cost of routes are initial 0, now we have K costs to be assigned to some of them,each cost should be assigned to different route 
, and the distance of two cities are cosidered the sum of route costs to go from one to the other,
and our goal is to make the sum of all pair distance minimum (i,j) (j,i) should be considered the same  


Input:
The first line of the input is the number of testcases
At each testcase first line contains two integers N,K (2?K<N?100000) ¡X the number of city , the number of costs to be assigned
Each of the following n?1 lines contains two integers ui and vi means the two city exist a route between them
It's guarantee these N cities and N-1 routes form a tree

Output:
Print one integer that is equal to the sum of distances between all pairs of cities after optimally assigned the costs
Since the answer may be large print the answer modulo 998244353
